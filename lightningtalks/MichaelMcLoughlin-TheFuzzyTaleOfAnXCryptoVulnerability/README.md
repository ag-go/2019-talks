On March 20, 2019, the [Go team released a patch for a security vulnerability in `x/crypto/salsa20`](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/1X7VG7FDw2A). This talk will regale you with the full story from [discovery by differential fuzzing](https://github.com/mmcloughlin/cryptofuzz), via low-level assembly root cause analysis to the [contentious disclosure process](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/1108637226089496577).

Along the way we'll explore testing practices for security-critical software, in particular the use of `go-fuzz` to check compatibility with reference implementations. Ultimately we'll see how even the most subtle of mistakes in assembly code can have catastrophic implications.
